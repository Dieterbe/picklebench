Simple python pickle methods benchmark program.
Be aware that loading should be faster because of 2 reasons:
* disk reads are faster than writes
* unless the files are very big (~size of RAM or bigger), they'll come from the Linux block cache in RAM

Depends:
* python (tested with 2.7)
* jsonpickle (tested with 3.1)
